# oop_battleFieldGame_sdl
Using OOP model, and SDL Engine in C++, I created a game called 'BattleField' that has a tank, bullet, and fire shots as an asset. Animation for the game, and its functionality is implemented using SDL Engine and its functions. You can compile the game on your computer after downloading C++, and SDL.
